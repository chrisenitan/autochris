General scripts I use in managing everythiing around; web scraping, browser controls, peripherals 

## Some of what it does
1. Make all screens at my desk dark so my eyes don't hurt
2. Alternate colors on the screen to give the room a bit more character at night
3. Boxed screen divisions to enable light intensity control in the room
4. Delete all chat messages on Slack
5. Get and watch some sites for changes.
